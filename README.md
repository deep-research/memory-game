## Comments

* React is great, but it takes a bit of getting used to. The key thing here was to understand that data should be passed from parent to child.
* Topics for study:
    * ES6 syntax
    * Connecting components together to create an organized file structure
    * Sending data through the file structure with props
    * `setState()` to keep track of changing data in the state object
    * Lifecycle events such as `componentDidMount()`
